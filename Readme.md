In this exercise I tried to build a complete test of the functionality of creating 
a new project where two bugs are created and then linked.

All the logic of the classes is collected in one test, so that your project in Jira is not filled with unnecessary issues.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

!!! In case of a bad Internet connection or a weak signal, it is possible to log this 
error: "WARNING: Connection reset". This is a temporary issue and you may need to run the tests again.!!!
